## **2. Approach (STAR Methodology)**  

### **Situation**  
- **Data Sources**: Sales transactions (2020-2022), customer demographics, product categories, and regional data.  
- **Key Challenges**:  
  - Disparate data tables needed consolidation.  
  - YoY comparisons were manual and time-consuming.  
  - No centralized view of sales performance vs. targets.  

### **Task**  
- **Build an interactive Power BI dashboard** to:  
  - Track sales by **continent, country, year, and product**.  
  - Analyze **margin trends** and **order quantities**.  
  - Compare **monthly sales** and **YoY growth**.  

### **Action**  
1. **Data Import & Cleaning (Power Query)**  
   - Merged **Sales, Customer, Product, and Territory tables**.  
   - Corrected inconsistencies (e.g., **July 2022 sales anomaly**).  

2. **Data Modeling (Star Schema)**  
   - Created relationships:  
     - **Fact Table**: Sales (connected to Customer, Product, Territory, Date).  
     - **Dimension Tables**: Customer, Product, Territory, Date.  

3. **DAX Measures for KPIs**  
   - **YoY Growth**:  
     ```DAX
     YoY % Change = DIVIDE([Total Sales 2022] - [Total Sales 2021], [Total Sales 2021])  
     ```  
     (Result: **+159.03% growth in 2022**).  
   - **Margin % by Product**:  
     ```DAX
     Margin % = DIVIDE([Sum of Line Margin], [Sum of Line Total Sales])  
     ```  
     (Bikes: **39%**, Clothing: **30%**, Accessories: **63%**).  

4. **Visualizations**  
   - **Clustered Column Charts**: Sales by continent and year.  
   - **Line Charts**: Monthly trends with YoY comparisons.  
   - **KPI Cards**: Total Sales ($17.8M), Margin (41%), vs. Target ($780K).
